"Normalized Group Activations Based Feature Extraction Technique using Heterogeneous Data for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification"

The study proposes a novel deep learning approach for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) patterns using neuroimaging data like structural MRI and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). It introduces a feature extraction technique based on normalized group activations, organized into two phases: multi-trait condensed feature extraction networks and regional association networks. Initially, features are extracted from various brain regions using multi-layered convolutional networks. Subsequently, regional association networks process these features with normalized group activations for regional pairs, and their outputs are used by a classifier. The system was tested using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, covering various stages of AD and incorporating heterogeneous features like curvelets, wavelets, and textures.
